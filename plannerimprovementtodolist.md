# Planner Improvement To-Do List

A concise, data-driven roadmap to evolve the logic module into a state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning engine while keeping code lean and transparent.

---

## 0. Core Principles

- **Less code, more data** â€“ behaviour lives in editable graphs/templates rather than nested Python.
- **Declarative reasoning** â€“ small set of primitives (`SEQ`, `PAR`, `COND`, `CALL`, `EVAL`, `STORE`).
- **Memory-first** â€“ fetch & learn rules from mem0, minimise hard-coded logic.
- **Self-introspective** â€“ runtime trace, hot-reload, guarded self-modification.
- **Auditability & safety** â€“ every step logged; SafetyGuard gate for risky patches.

## 1. Milestone Checklist

### M1 â€“ Primitive Extraction  

âœ… Define and unit-test minimal primitives (â‰¤15 LOC each).  
âœ… Create registry for hot-swappable primitives.

### M2 â€“ Graph-Based Planner  

âœ… Represent templates as YAML/JSON logic graphs.  
âœ… Implement graph loader â†’ node objects.  
âœ… Replace old recursion with graph traversal executor.

### M3 â€“ Memory-Augmented Rules  

ðŸŸ¡ On plan request, search mem0 for matching graph (fallback â†’ local template).  
â¬œ Store generated graphs back to mem0 with usage metrics.

### M4 â€“ Introspection & Hot-Reload  

â¬œ Expose `GET_LOGIC_GRAPH` / `PATCH_GRAPH` via Introspector.  
â¬œ Add CLI (or REST) helper for live editing.

### M5 â€“ Trace & Explainability  

â¬œ Emit `logic.trace` events (node, primitive, in/out, duration).  
â¬œ Implement `explain(goal_id)` to reconstruct reasoning chain.

### M6 â€“ Safety & Rollback  

â¬œ Sandbox test every graph patch (unit tests + mypy).  
â¬œ Version graphs in mem0; enable 1-click rollback.

### M7 â€“ Stress & Regression  

â¬œ Build goal corpus (simple â†’ multi-domain).  
â¬œ Fuzz primitives for edge cases.  
â¬œ Keep core executor â‰¤400 LOC; refactor if exceeded.

## 3. Definition of Done

- All M1-M7 tasks checked.  
- Core executor â‰¤ **400 LOC**.  
- 95 % unit-test coverage for primitives & loader.  
- Average plan generation < **50 ms**.  
- New rule integration â‰¤ **5 min, zero code changes**.  
- Trace/explain outputs human-readable and passes audit review.
