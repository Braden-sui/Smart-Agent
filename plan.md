# Simulated Mind: Roadmap to End-Grade Architecture

---

## 1. Live mem0 Backend Integration

- **Goal:** Replace in-process mem0 stub with a real backend, enabling persistent, multi-user, multi-session knowledge graphs.
- **Steps:**
  1. Research mem0 deployment options (hosted/cloud, local, API/SDK).
  2. Implement connection logic and config for endpoint/credentials.
  3. Update `Mem0Client` to use HTTP/SDK calls; add robust error handling.
  4. Add integration tests for persistence, multi-session, and recovery.

## 2. Planner Expansion: Deep Recursion, Templates, Prioritization

- **Goal:** Transform Planner into a recursive, template-rich, memory-prioritized engine.
- **Steps:**
  1. Implement recursive decomposition (configurable depth).
  2. Expand and modularize `planner_rules.py` for richer, user-editable templates.
  3. Integrate memory-based prioritization (score subtasks by relevance/recall).
  4. Integrate with a concrete `TaskManager` and `Goal` dataclass.

### Planner Improvement To-Do List (Detailed)

> This subsection merges the standalone `plannerimprovementtodolist.md` into the main roadmap. It offers granular guidance for evolving the planner while keeping code lean and transparent.

#### Core Principles

- **Less code, more data** â€“ behaviour lives in editable graphs/templates rather than nested Python.
- **Declarative reasoning** â€“ small set of primitives (`SEQ`, `PAR`, `COND`, `CALL`, `EVAL`, `STORE`).
- **Memory-first** â€“ fetch & learn rules from mem0, minimise hard-coded logic.
- **Self-introspective** â€“ runtime trace, hot-reload, guarded self-modification.
- **Auditability & safety** â€“ every step logged; SafetyGuard gate for risky patches.

#### Milestone Checklist

| Milestone | Status | Key Deliverables |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **M1 â€“ Primitive Extraction** | âœ… | Minimal primitives (â‰¤15 LOC each) & registry |
| **M2 â€“ Graph-Based Planner** | âœ… | YAML/JSON graphs, loader, executor replaces recursion |
| **M3 â€“ Memory-Augmented Rules** | ðŸŸ¡ | mem0 search for graphs; store usage metrics |
| **M4 â€“ Introspection & Hot-Reload** | â¬œ | `GET_LOGIC_GRAPH`, `PATCH_GRAPH`, live editing CLI |
| **M5 â€“ Trace & Explainability** | â¬œ | `logic.trace` events, `explain(goal_id)` reconstruction |
| **M6 â€“ Safety & Rollback** | â¬œ | Sandbox tests, versioned graphs, one-click rollback |
| **M7 â€“ Stress & Regression** | â¬œ | Goal corpus, fuzz tests, executor â‰¤400 LOC |

#### Stretch / SOTA Enhancements

| Idea | Benefit | Effort |
|------|---------|--------|
| **LLM-Assisted Graph Synthesis** | Draft new logic graphs from natural-language goals. | â˜…â˜…â˜… |
| **Dynamic Tool Selection** | Function-calling LLM activates external APIs/tools on the fly. | â˜…â˜… |
| **MCTS / Planning-as-Search** | Better global optimisation for long-horizon goals. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… |
| **Reinforcement Learning of Primitive Weights** | Adaptive prioritisation of alternative sub-plans. | â˜…â˜…â˜… |
| **Neural-Symbolic Hybrid** | Small LM decides `COND` branches when rule unclear. | â˜…â˜… |
| **Multi-Agent Plan Negotiation** | Share graphs between SubAgents and converge via voting. | â˜…â˜…â˜… |

#### Definition of Done

- All **M1â€“M7** tasks completed.
- Core executor â‰¤ **400 LOC**.
- â‰¥ 95 % unit-test coverage for primitives & loader.
- Average plan generation < **50 ms**.
- New rule integration â‰¤ **5 min**, zero code changes.
- Trace/explain outputs human-readable and passes audit review.

## 3. LearningLoop Enhancement: Automated Self-Improvement

- **Goal:** Enable the agent to mine its own logs and performance for self-improvement.
- **Steps:**
  1. Implement behaviour mining: scan journals/mem0 for patterns, failures, and successes.
  2. Develop self-improvement routines that propose/plans code or strategy changes.
  3. Trigger self-modification cycles based on mined insights.
  4. Log all learning events for auditability.

## 4. SafetyGuard Upgrade: Full Lint/Test/Sandbox/Signing

- **Goal:** Make all self-modification robust, secure, and auditable.
- **Steps:**
  1. Integrate `ruff` and `mypy` for lint/type-check gating.
  2. Add selective unit test running (only affected modules).
  3. Prototype a dynamic sandbox for patch evaluation.
  4. Scaffold cryptographic signing for multi-writer hash chains.

## 5. CodeModifier: Parallelism, Speculation, Rollback

- **Goal:** Allow safe, parallel patch proposals and automatic rollback on failure.
- **Steps:**
  1. Implement patch queueing and speculative (sandboxed) execution.
  2. Auto-rollback on failed safety checks or negative learning outcomes.
  3. Journal all patch attempts, successes, and rollbacks.

## 6. Task/Goal Management, Contradiction Detection, Emotion Model

- **Goal:** Add robust task/goal tracking, contradiction logging, and emotion-driven planning.
- **Steps:**
  1. Implement `TaskManager` and `Goal` dataclass with full lifecycle.
  2. Add contradiction detection and logging in planner/agent.
  3. Integrate a basic emotion model to modulate planning and learning.

## 7. Environment/World Simulation & API Adapters

- **Goal:** Enable agents to interact with simulated or real external environments.
- **Steps:**
  1. Design plug-in adapter interface for world/environment modules.
  2. Implement at least one simulation and one real API adapter.
  3. Add tests and demos for environment interaction.

## 8. CI, Audit, and Documentation

- **Goal:** Ensure production-grade reliability, traceability, and onboarding.
- **Steps:**
  1. Set up CI matrix for lint, test, and hash-chain verification.
  2. Add auto-generated API documentation (Sphinx or mkdocs).
  3. Create architecture diagrams and onboarding guides.

**Recommended Order:**  1 â†’ 2 â†’ 4 â†’ 5 â†’ 3 â†’ 6 â†’ 7 â†’ 8 (parallelize where possible)

This plan should be reviewed and updated as each milestone is completed or if priorities shift.
