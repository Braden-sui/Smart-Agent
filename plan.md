# Simulated Mind: Roadmap to End-Grade Architecture

---

## 1. Live mem0 Backend Integration

- **Goal:** Replace in-process mem0 stub with a real backend, enabling persistent, multi-user, multi-session knowledge graphs.
- **Steps:**
  1. Research mem0 deployment options (hosted/cloud, local, API/SDK).
  2. Implement connection logic and config for endpoint/credentials.
  3. Update `Mem0Client` to use HTTP/SDK calls; add robust error handling.
  4. Add integration tests for persistence, multi-session, and recovery.

## 2. Planner Expansion: Deep Recursion, Templates, Prioritization

- **Goal:** Transform Planner into a recursive, template-rich, memory-prioritized engine.
- **Steps:**
  1. Implement recursive decomposition (configurable depth).
  2. Expand and modularize `planner_rules.py` for richer, user-editable templates.
  3. Integrate memory-based prioritization (score subtasks by relevance/recall).
  4. Integrate with a concrete `TaskManager` and `Goal` dataclass.

## 3. LearningLoop Enhancement: Automated Self-Improvement

- **Goal:** Enable the agent to mine its own logs and performance for self-improvement.
- **Steps:**
  1. Implement behaviour mining: scan journals/mem0 for patterns, failures, and successes.
  2. Develop self-improvement routines that propose/plans code or strategy changes.
  3. Trigger self-modification cycles based on mined insights.
  4. Log all learning events for auditability.

## 4. SafetyGuard Upgrade: Full Lint/Test/Sandbox/Signing

- **Goal:** Make all self-modification robust, secure, and auditable.
- **Steps:**
  1. Integrate `ruff` and `mypy` for lint/type-check gating.
  2. Add selective unit test running (only affected modules).
  3. Prototype a dynamic sandbox for patch evaluation.
  4. Scaffold cryptographic signing for multi-writer hash chains.

## 5. CodeModifier: Parallelism, Speculation, Rollback

- **Goal:** Allow safe, parallel patch proposals and automatic rollback on failure.
- **Steps:**
  1. Implement patch queueing and speculative (sandboxed) execution.
  2. Auto-rollback on failed safety checks or negative learning outcomes.
  3. Journal all patch attempts, successes, and rollbacks.

## 6. Task/Goal Management, Contradiction Detection, Emotion Model

- **Goal:** Add robust task/goal tracking, contradiction logging, and emotion-driven planning.
- **Steps:**
  1. Implement `TaskManager` and `Goal` dataclass with full lifecycle.
  2. Add contradiction detection and logging in planner/agent.
  3. Integrate a basic emotion model to modulate planning and learning.

## 7. Environment/World Simulation & API Adapters

- **Goal:** Enable agents to interact with simulated or real external environments.
- **Steps:**
  1. Design plug-in adapter interface for world/environment modules.
  2. Implement at least one simulation and one real API adapter.
  3. Add tests and demos for environment interaction.

## 8. CI, Audit, and Documentation

- **Goal:** Ensure production-grade reliability, traceability, and onboarding.
- **Steps:**
  1. Set up CI matrix for lint, test, and hash-chain verification.
  2. Add auto-generated API documentation (Sphinx or mkdocs).
  3. Create architecture diagrams and onboarding guides.

**Recommended Order:**  1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 3 → 6 → 7 → 8 (parallelize where possible)

This plan should be reviewed and updated as each milestone is completed or if priorities shift.
